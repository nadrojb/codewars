Please note Codewars Rules:

Please do not post your solutions on Github (or alike). We realize you would like to use these challenges as your resume, but you should have side-projects for that. If an user is unable to find a solution online, then they are further encouraged to complete the task themselves - which will enable them to get more value out of their time spent.


This repo is for my own use to look at past solutions when I come across new problems, for your own sake please do not use it to complete your own soltutions as you will not learn by copying and pasting others solutions without problem solving yourself.

Thanks!
